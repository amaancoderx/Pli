                        On February 1, 1884, Postal Life Insurance (PLI), the oldest insurer in the country was
                        introduced under the Queen Empress of India with the express approval of the Secretary of State
                        (for India) to Her Majesty. The scheme at the time was intended as welfare scheme to benefit
                        Postal service employees. It was later extended to employees of Telegraph department in 1884. In
                        its early initiation days the maximum insurance amount limit was Rs.4,000, currently at Rs. 50
